In this study we analyse new contructions in regular expressions, which were created in programing languages. We focus on lookaround separately in its positive and negative form. We study closure properties of classes of Chomsky hierarchy under these operations. Furthermore we explore lookaround combined with different sets of operations of regular expressions. We prove that basic set with lookaround covers only the class of regular languages. We create new complex languages that cannot be pumped by pumping lema in set expanded by backreferences and positive lookaround. Addition of lookaround ensures closure under intersection and its negative form provides closure under complement.
